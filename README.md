# My Portfolio

Welcome! The [live site](https://danielloewensteinportfolio.vercel.app/) of my portfolio is already pretty information-heavy, so if you ended up here, you either want to see the source code or want to know even _more_ about me. Either way, hope you find what you're looking for!

## About The Portfolio:

This portfolio site was built with CSS, React, and a lot of Reactstrap. Thanks to some great instruction and a clear vision, it took about three days to code the basics. And thanks to continued growth in my engineering knowledge and learning more about what ought to be part of a portfolio (and some regrettable perfectionist tendencies üòÇ), bits and pieces continued to evolve over two months. You know how it is.

## More About Me:

### Background

I worked in the Jewish Education space for over a decade, beginning in formal classroom settings and eventually joining [Aleph Beta](https://www.alephbeta.org), a media company that creates videos and podcasts about the Torah. I learned a lot at Aleph Beta, including some unexpected things, like how to voice act (sort of), how to do audio editing, how to run a team and how to be a mentor.

Along the way, I picked up a PhD in Jewish Education, where I studied moral development and researched how Jewish educators teach values and what gets in the way. I also picked up some formal training in interviewing, which everyone should do, because it helps you realize that everyone and everything is interesting, and life is just better when you realize that.

I made the switch to tech in May 2023, when I joined General Assembly's software engineering immersive program, and was quickly blown away by the sheer scale of what you can do with just a little HTML, CSS and Javascript. I was trained as a full stack developer, and setting up databases and backends and API is cool, but if I had my way I'd just make frontend-only games all day, the more diverse and skill-pushing the better.

I am a reasonably satisfied native of Long Island, NY, where I live with my amazing wife and three kids.

### Fun Facts

- **My Favorite Musician**: Andrew McMahon. I sometimes can't understand why he isn't a bigger deal.
- **My Favorite Productivity Apps**: Focusmate (for the accountability) and Habitica (for the dopamine).
- **My Best Teaching Moment**: My 2011 creative writing students and I published a collection of their short stories, and some of them are excellent.
- **My Favorite Podcast**: Modern Wisdom. Chris Williamson is a great interviewer, he knows how to balance listening and contributing. Though, disclaimer, I don't really listen to the episodes about dating.
- **My Favorite Book**: Has to be _Harry Potter_, it just feels like family at this point. But some honorable mentions: A lot of Orson Scott Card's stuff made a big impact on me, especially _The Worthing Saga_ and the original Ender series. And _HPMOR_ is enlightening and unfairly funny.

### Works in Progress

I'm currently working on:

- A networking app for Jewish professionals that integrates Calendly
- A medical reminder app that integrates Google Calendar API

### GitHub Stats:

People seem to post this, though I've never heard about it mattering to anyone. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Credits

Credit where credit is due, I drew a lot of inspiration for this site's layout and design from [Matt Farley's](https://mattfarley.ca/) portfolio, y'all should check it out.

I also learned a lot about what makes a good portfolio from [Lisa Dubler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisadublercoaching/), and from watching [CodingPhase's](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingPhase) portfolio reviews.

And the knowledge to actually create this site came from...well, Google and Stack Overflow, mostly, but the knowledge of how to find those resources and make sense of them came from the excellent instruction I got at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/new-york-city), and specifically from [Michael Lackey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelglackey/), [Jan Horak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-horak/), [Viridiana Flores](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viridianaflores/) and [Ashley Sands](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-sands/).
